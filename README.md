## Project Summary

This repo contains methods for optogenetic experiments aimed toward generating rewarding and aversive stimulation. (languages: MATLAB, Octave)

Here we are testing rats/mice in an open field apparatus. The open field can be divide into N number of spatial zones of any shape, physically or virtually. A video camera (webcam, IR thermal cam, etc.) is positioned above the field and records the animal. The program collects frames from this live video feed, processes these images, and determines which zone the animal currently resides. Based on this information, the program then sends a pulse pattern to the fiber optic embedded in the subject's brain. These pulses can be of any pattern, and can be assigned to each particular zone.
